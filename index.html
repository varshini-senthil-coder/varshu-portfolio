                 <br>AGE: 19
                 <br>COLLEGE: ADITHYA INSTITUTION OF TECHNOLOGY

         <br>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are  like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
        I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people’s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
        This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my articles or take a look at my pictures. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.</h1>

    <br>PROGRAMMING IDEAS:
    <br>For young developers, coding projects are like the final boss in a video game. They challenge you to learn vital coding skills and translate your theoretical knowledge into actual code. Besides testing your ability to recount what you’ve already learned, building simple apps will also teach you how to structure coding projects, deploy code, and debug applications once they’re live. 
        The apps you build will also help you make inroads in the software industry. With enough projects under your belt, you can build a portfolio, which shows recruiters that you have both the technical skills and the passion to excel in the industry. Employers appreciate when junior developer candidates have some real-world experience, even if that experience is just projects that they’ve built in their own time. 
        It can be intimidating to get started, but the best-way to gain hands-on experience is to simply start coding! Building your first application (even if it's a really simple application like your own website, a random number generator, or own chess game) is a great way to build your skills, master coding fundamentals, and your confidence. You can also look for open source projects you can join that welcomes new coders.
        There are all kinds of coding projects you can work on and add to your to-do list. Read on to learn more about some fun coding projects that will put your skills to the test. (See here if coding is hard to learn, especially if you eventually want to become a software engineer.)
